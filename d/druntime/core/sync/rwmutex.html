<dl><dt><big>class <u>ReadWriteMutex</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>This class represents a mutex that allows any number of readers to enter,
 but when a writer enters, all other readers and writers are blocked.
<br><br>
Please note that this mutex is not recursive and is intended to guard access
 to data only.  Also, no deadlock checking is in place because doing so would
 require dynamic memory allocation, which would reduce performance by an
 unacceptable amount.  As a result, any attempt to recursively acquire this
 mutex may well deadlock the caller, particularly if a write lock is acquired
 while holding a read lock, or vice-versa.  In practice, this should not be
 an issue however, because it is uncommon to call deeply into unknown code
 while holding a lock that simply protects data.
 
<br><br>

<dl><dt><big>enum <u>Policy</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>Defines the policy used by this mutex.  Currently, two policies are
 defined.
<br><br>
The first will queue writers until no readers hold the mutex, then
 pass the writers through one at a time.  If a reader acquires the mutex
 while there are still writers queued, the reader will take precedence.
<br><br>

 The second will queue readers if there are any writers queued.  Writers
 are passed through one at a time, and once there are no writers present,
 all queued readers will be alerted.
<br><br>

 Future policies may offer a more even balance between reader and writer
 precedence.
     
<br><br>

<dl><dt><big><u>PREFER_READERS</u></big></dt>
<dd>Readers get preference.  This may starve writers.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><u>PREFER_WRITERS</u></big></dt>
<dd>Writers get preference.  This may starve readers.
<br><br>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><big>this(Policy <i>policy</i> = (Policy).PREFER_WRITERS);
</big></dt>
<dd>Initializes a read/write mutex object with the supplied <i>policy</i>.
<br><br>
<b>Params:</b><br>

<td>The <i>policy</i> to use.</td></tr>
</table><br>
<b>Throws:</b><br>
SyncException on error.

<dt><big>Policy <u>policy</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>Gets the <u>policy</u> for the associated mutex.

<b>Returns:</b><br>
The <u>policy</u> used by this mutex.
     
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big>Reader <u>reader</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>Gets an object representing the <u>reader</u> lock for the associated mutex.

A <u>reader</u> sub-mutex.

<dd>This class can be considered a mutex in its own right, and is used to
 negotiate a read lock for the enclosing mutex.

<dd>Acquires a read <u>lock</u> on the enclosing mutex.
         
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big>void <u>unlock</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>Releases a read lock on the enclosing mutex.
         
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big>bool <u>tryLock</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>Attempts to acquire a read lock on the enclosing mutex.  If one can
 be obtained without blocking, the lock is acquired and <b>true</b> is
 returned.  If not, the lock is not acquired and <b>false</b> is returned.
<br><br>
